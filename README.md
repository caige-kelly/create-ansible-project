# Create-Ansible-Project

## Abstract

The goal of this program is to create a simple Ansible playbook that represents
a typical best practice file structure and build out an example playbook that 
incorporates standard Ansible practices such as: roles, vars, handlers,
group_vars, host_vars, and what ever else people find useful.

TLDR: The concept is a clone of create-react-app

## Installation

The intent is for the program to be written in C because why not and to be
distributed via pip.

So if all goes according to plan installation should be

```bash
pip install create-ansible-project
``` 

## TODO

1. create directory structure
1. create files in directories
1. create main playbook and two roles
1. build out rest of playbook
1. possible add option to create python env in dir
1. probably add some switches like --no-handler, --role-names=one,two,three

## Contributing

Any and all contributions are welcomed. Submit an issue, a PR, or steal the idea
and write it in python in 1/3 the time. This is my first project in C so it's
going to be slow and steady.
